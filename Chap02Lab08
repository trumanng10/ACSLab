To check if AppArmor is enabled and exists in the security profiles on your system, follow these steps:

Check if AppArmor is installed:
Run the following command to check if AppArmor is installed:

dpkg -l | grep apparmor
If AppArmor is installed, you should see a package like apparmor listed.

Check if AppArmor is running:
To verify if the AppArmor service is running, use:

sudo systemctl status apparmor
If it’s running, you will see output showing that the apparmor service is active.

Check AppArmor security profiles:
To view the security profiles that AppArmor is using, you can check the /etc/apparmor.d/ directory:

ls /etc/apparmor.d/
This directory contains all the AppArmor security profiles on your system.

Check the status of AppArmor profiles:
Use the aa-status command to check the status of all AppArmor profiles:

sudo aa-status
This will list the loaded profiles and their statuses (whether they are enforced, complain, or unconfined).

Check AppArmor support in Docker:
To verify if AppArmor is being used by Docker containers, you can check the Docker daemon’s logs or use the following command to list all containers with their security options:

docker inspect --format '{{.HostConfig.SecurityOpt}}' <container_name_or_id>
These steps will help you confirm if AppArmor exists and is actively being used in the security profiles of your system.




#3.	From the preceding excerpt, we can see that Apparmor exists in the security profiles. Let us now create a new file called apparmor-profile using a text editor and add the following lines of code inside it.

mkdir apparmor
cd apparmor
vi apparmor-profile


# 4.	Add the following lines:

#include <tunables/global>
profile apparmor-profile flags=(attach_disconnected,mediate_deleted) {
  #include <abstractions/base>
  file,
  network,
  capability,
  deny /tmp/** w,
  deny /etc/passwd rwklx,
}


# 5.	To verify if these AppArmor rules are working fine, let us spin up a container using this AppArmor profile using the following command：

docker run -itd --security-opt apparmor=apparmor-profile alpine


#6.	The AppArmor profile that we are trying to use with the container is not loaded yet. To load it, let us use the following command：

sudo apparmor_parser -r -W apparmor-profile


#7.	Start the container again with 

docker ps -a
docker start <Container-ID>
docker exec -it <Container-ID> sh
