#3.	From the preceding excerpt, we can see that Apparmor exists in the security profiles. Let us now create a new file called apparmor-profile using a text editor and add the following lines of code inside it.

mkdir apparmor
cd apparmor
vi apparmor-profile


# 4.	Add the following lines:

#include <tunables/global>
profile apparmor-profile flags=(attach_disconnected,mediate_deleted) {
  #include <abstractions/base>
  file,
  network,
  capability,
  deny /tmp/** w,
  deny /etc/passwd rwklx,
}


# 5.	To verify if these AppArmor rules are working fine, let us spin up a container using this AppArmor profile using the following command：

docker run -itd --security-opt apparmor=apparmor-profile alpine


#6.	The AppArmor profile that we are trying to use with the container is not loaded yet. To load it, let us use the following command：

sudo apparmor_parser -r -W apparmor-profile


#7.	Start the container again with 

docker ps -a
docker start <Container-ID>
docker exec -it <Container-ID> sh
